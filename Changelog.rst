----------------------------------------

**2019-10-01**

* Complete refactor for Python 3, including some API changes.

  Scripts written for version 2.x but running under version 3.x should
  either work as expected, or provide informative error messages on
  the new API usage. However, it is advised that the outputs of older
  scripts be checked when running with Python 3 versions of the cf
  library.
* Deprecated ``cfdump`` (its functionality is now included in
  ``cfa``).

  off, now on)

----

version 2.3.5
-------------

version 0.9.8.2
---------------

**2014-03-13**

* Copes with PP fields with 365_day calendars
* Revamped CFA files in line with the evolving standard. CFA files
  from PP data created with a previous version will no longer work.

----

version 0.9.8
-------------

**2013-12-06**

* Improved API.
* Plenty of speed and memory optimisations.
* A proper treatment of datetimes.
* WGDOS-packed PP fields are now unpacked on demand.
* Fixed bug in functions.py for numpy v1.7. Fixed bug when deleting
  the 'id' attribute.
* Assign a standard name to aggregated PP fields after aggregation
  rather than before (because some stash codes are too similar,
  e.g. 407 and 408).
* New subclasses of `cf.Coordinate`: `cf.DimensionCoordinate` and
  `cf.AuxiliaryCoordinate`.
* A `cf.Units` object is now immutable.

----

version 0.9.7.1
---------------

**2013-04-26**

* Fixed endian bug in CFA-netCDF files referring to PP files
* Changed default output format to NETCDF3_CLASSIC and trap error when
  when writing unsigned integer types and the 64-bit integer type to
  file formats other than NETCDF4.
* Changed unhelpful history created when aggregating

----

version 0.9.7
-------------

**2013-04-24**

* Read and write CFA-netCDF files
* `cf.Field` creation interface
* New command line utilities: ``cfa``, ``cfdump``
* Redesigned repr, str and dump() output (which is shared with ``cfa``
  and ``cfdump``)
* Removed superseded (by ``cfa``) command line utilities ``pp2cf``,
  ``cf2cf``
* Renamed the 'subset' method to 'select'
* Now needs netCDF4-python 0.9.7 or later (and numpy 1.6 or later)

----

version 0.9.6.2
---------------

**2013-03-27**

* Fixed bug in ``cf/pp.py`` which caused the creation of incorrect
  latitude coordinate arrays.

----

version 0.9.6.1
---------------

**2013-02-20**

* Fixed bug in ``cf/netcdf.py`` which caused a failure when a file
  with badly formatted units was encountered.

----

version 0.9.6
-------------

**2012-11-27**

* Assignment to a field's data array with metadata-aware broadcasting,
  assigning to subspaces, assignment where data meets conditions,
  assignment to unmasked elements, etc. (setitem method)
* Proper treatment of the missing data mask, including metadata-aware
  assignment (setmask method)
* Proper treatment of ancillary data.
* Ancillary data and transforms are subspaced with their parent field.
* Much faster aggregation algorithm (with thanks to Jonathan
  Gregory). Also aggregates fields transforms, ancillary variables and
  flags.

----

version 0.9.5
-------------

**2012-10-01**

* Restructured documentation and package code files.
* Large Amounts of Massive Arrays (LAMA) functionality.
* Metadata-aware field manipulation and combination with
  metadata-aware broadcasting.
* Better treatment of cell measures.
* Slightly faster aggregation algorithm (a much improved one is in
  development).
* API changes for clarity.
* Bug fixes.
* Added 'TEMPDIR' to the `cf.CONSTANTS` dictionary
* This is a snapshot of the trunk at revision r195.

----

version 0.9.5.dev
-----------------

**2012-09-19**

* Loads of exciting improvements - mainly LAMA functionality,
  metadata-aware field manipulation and documentation.
* This is a snapshot of the trunk at revision r185. A proper vn0.9.5
  release is imminent.

----

version 0.9.4.2
---------------

**2012-04-17**

* General bug fixes and code restructure

----

version 0.9.4
-------------

**2012-03-15**

* A proper treatment of units using the Udunits C library and the
  extra time functionality provided by the netCDF4 package.
* A command line script to do CF-netCDF to CF-netCDF via cf-python.

----

version 0.9.3.3
---------------

**2012-02-08**

* Objects renamed in line with the CF data model: `cf.Space` becomes
  `cf.Field` and `cf.Grid` becomes `cf.Space`.
* Field aggregation using the CF aggregation rules is available when
  reading fields from disk and on fields in memory. The data of a
  field resulting from aggregation are stored as a collection of the
  data from the component fields and so, as before, may be file
  pointers, arrays in memory or a mixture of these two forms.
* Units, missing data flags, dimension order, dimension direction and
  packing flags may all be different between data components and are
  conformed at the time of data access.
* Files in UK Met Office PP format may now be read into CF fields.
* A command line script for PP to CF-netCDF file conversion is
  provided.

----

version 0.9.3
-------------

**2012-01-05**

* A more consistent treatment of spaces and lists of spaces
  (`cf.Space` and `cf.SpaceList` objects respectively).
* A corrected treatment of scalar or 1-d, size 1 dimensions in the
  space and its grid.
* Data stored in `cf.Data` objects which contain metadata need to
  correctly interpret and manipulate the data. This will be
  particularly useful when data arrays spanning many files/arrays is
  implemented.

----

version 0.9.2
-------------

**2011-08-26**

* Created a ``setup.py`` script for easier installation (with thanks
  to Jeff Whitaker).
* Added support for reading OPeNDAP-hosted datasets given by URLs.
* Restructured the documentation.
* Created a test directory with scripts and sample output.
* No longer fails for unknown calendar types (such as ``'360d'``).

----

version 0.9.1
-------------

**2011-08-06**

* First release.
