**Introduction**
================

----

Version |release| for version |version| of the CF conventions.

The Python `cf` package is an Earth Science data analysis library that
is built on a complete implementation of the :ref:`CF-data-model`.

**Functionality**
-----------------

The `cf` package implements the :ref:`CF-data-model` for its internal
data structures and so is able to process any CF-compliant dataset. It
is not strict about CF-compliance, however, so that partially
conformant datasets may be ingested from existing datasets and written
to new datasets.This is so that datasets that are partially conformant
may nonetheless be modified in memory.

   :caption: *A basic example of reading a field construct from a
             file and inspecting it.*

   >>> import cf
   >>> f = cf.read('file.nc')
   >>> f
   [<CF Field: air_temperature(time(12), latitude(64), longitude(128)) K>]
   >>> print(f[0])
   Field: air_temperature (ncvar%tas)
   ----------------------------------
   Data            : air_temperature(time(12), latitude(64), longitude(128)) K
   Cell methods    : time(12): mean (interval: 1.0 month)
   Dimension coords: time(12) = [1991-11-16 00:00:00, ..., 1991-10-16 12:00:00] noleap
                   : latitude(64) = [-87.8638, ..., 87.8638] degrees_north
                   : longitude(128) = [0.0, ..., 357.1875] degrees_east
                   : height(1) = [2.0] m

The `cf` package uses :ref:`Dask <Performance>` for all of its array
manipulation and can:

* read :term:`field constructs <field construct>` and :term:`domain
  constructs <domain construct>` from netCDF, CDL, PP and UM datasets,

* create new field constructs in memory,

* write and append field constructs to netCDF datasets on disk,

* read, write, and create coordinates defined by geometry cells,

* read netCDF and CDL datasets containing hierarchical groups,

* inspect field constructs,

* test whether two field constructs are the same,

* modify field construct metadata and data,

* create subspaces of field constructs,

* write field constructs to netCDF datasets on disk,

* incorporate, and create, metadata stored in external files,

* read, write, and create data that have been compressed by convention
  (i.e. ragged or gathered arrays, or coordinate arrays compressed by
  subsampling), whilst presenting a view of the data in its
  uncompressed form,

* combine field constructs arithmetically,

* manipulate field construct data by arithmetical and trigonometrical
  operations,

* perform statistical collapses on field constructs,

* perform histogram, percentile and binning operations on field
  constructs,

* regrid field constructs with (multi-)linear, nearest neighbour,
  first- and second-order conservative and higher order patch recovery
  methods,

* apply convolution filters to field constructs,

* create running means from field constructs,

* apply differential operators to field constructs,

* create derived quantities (such as relative vorticity).

**Visualisation**
-----------------

Powerful, flexible, and user-friendly visualisations of field
constructs are available with the `cf-plot` package that is installed
separately to `cf` (see http://ajheaps.github.io/cf-plot for details).

See the `cf-plot gallery
<http://ajheaps.github.io/cf-plot/gallery.html>`_ for the wide range
of plotting possibilities with example code.

**Performance**
---------------

As of version 3.14.0 (released 2023-01-31), cf uses :ref:`Dask
<Performance>` for all of its data manipulations, which provides lazy,
parallelised, and out-of-core computations of array operations.

----

**Command line utilities**
--------------------------

During installation the ``cfa`` command line utility is also
installed, which

* generates text descriptions of field constructs contained in files,
  and

* creates new datasets aggregated from existing files.
