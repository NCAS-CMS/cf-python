Calculating and plotting the divergence of sea currents
=======================================================

In this recipe, we will calculate the divergence of depth-averaged
currents in the Irish Sea, then plot the divergence as a contour
fill plot underneath the vectors themselves in the form of a vector plot.
"""

# %%
# 1. Import cf-python and cf-plot:
import cfplot as cfp
import cf

# %%
# 2. Read the fields in:
f = cf.read(
    "~/summerstudents/final-recipes/new-required-datasets/POLCOMS_WAM_ZUV_01_16012006.nc")

# %%
# 3. Get the separate vector components, which are stored as separate fields.
# The first, 'u', corresponds to the eastward component and the second, 'v',
# the northward component:
u = f[0]
v = f[1]

# %%
# 4. Squeeze the fields to remove the size 1 axes in each case:
u = u.squeeze()
v = v.squeeze()

# %%
# 5. Consider the currents at a set point in time. To do this we
# select one of the 720 datetime sample points in the fields to
# investigate, in this case by subspacing to pick out a particular
# datetime value we saw within the time coordinate data of the field (but
# you could also use indexing or filtering to select a specific value).
# Once we subspace to one datetime, we squeeze out the size 1 time axis
# in each case:
chosen_time = "2006-01-15 23:30:00"  # 720 choices to pick from, try this one!
u_1 = u.subspace(T=cf.dt(chosen_time))
v_1 = v.subspace(T=cf.dt(chosen_time))
u_1 = u_1.squeeze()
v_1 = v_1.squeeze()

# %%
# 6.
# When inspecting the u and v fields using cf inspection methods such as
# from print(u_1.data) and u_1.data.dump(), for example, we can see that there are
# lots of -9999 values in their data array, apparently used as a
# fill/placeholder value, including to indicate undefined data over the land.
# In order for these to not skew the data and dominate the plot, we need
# to mask values matching this, so that only meaningful values remain.
u_2 = u_1.where(cf.lt(-9000), cf.masked)
v_2 = v_1.where(cf.lt(-9000), cf.masked)

# %%
# 7. Calculate the divergence using the 'div_xy' function operating on the
# vector eastward and northward components as the first and second argument
# respectively. We need to calculate this for the latitude-longitude plane
# of the Earth, defined in spherical polar coordinates, so we must specify
# the Earth's radius for the appropriate calculation:
div = cf.div_xy(u_2, v_2, radius="earth")

# %%
# 8. Generate the final plot. First we configure the overall plot by
# making the map higher resolution, to show the coastlines of the UK and
# Ireland in greater detail, and changing the colourmap to better reflect
# the data which can be positive or negative, i.e. has 0 as the 'middle'
# value of significance, so should use a diverging colour map. Then we
# plot the current vectors, noting we had to play around with the 'stride'
# and 'scale' parameter values to adjust the vector spacing and size so that
# the vector field is best represented and visible without over-cluttering
# the plot. Finally we plot the divergence as a contour plot without any
# lines showing. This compound plot is saved on one canvas using 'gopen'
# and 'gclose' to wrap the two plotting calls:
cfp.mapset(resolution="10m")
cfp.cscale("ncl_default")
cfp.gopen(
    file=f"irish-sea-currents-divergence-{chosen_time.replace(' ', '-')}.png")
cfp.vect(u=u_2, v=v_2, stride=6, scale=3, key_length=1)
cfp.con(
    div,
    lines=False,
    title=(
        f"Depth-averaged Irish Sea currents at {chosen_time} with "
        "their divergence"
    )
)
cfp.gclose()
