"""
Calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between datasets
================================================================

In this recipe, we will take two datasets, one for an independent variable
(in this example elevation) and one for a dependent variable (snow
cover over a particular day), regrid them to the same resolution then
calculate the correlation coefficient, to get a measure of the relationship
between them.

# %%
# 1. Import cf-python, cf-plot and other required packages:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy.stats.mstats as mstats
import cfplot as cfp

import cf


# %%
# 2. Read the data in and unpack the Fields from FieldLists using indexing.
# In our example We are investigating the influence of the land height on
# the snow cover extent, so snow cover is the dependent variable. The snow
# cover data is the
# 'Snow Cover Extent 2017-present (raster 500 m), Europe, daily â€“ version 1'
# sourced from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service which is described at:
# https://land.copernicus.eu/en/products/snow/snow-cover-extent-europe-v1-0-500m
# and the elevation data is the 'NOAA NGDC GLOBE topo: elevation data' dataset
# which can be sourced from the IRI Data Library, or details found, at:
# http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NOAA/.NGDC/.GLOBE/.topo/index.html.
orog = cf.read("~/recipes/1km_elevation.nc")[0]
snow = cf.read("~/recipes/snowcover")[0]

# %%
# 3. Choose the day of pre-aggregated snow cover to investigate. We will
# take the first datetime element corresponding to the first day from the
# datasets, 1st January 2024, but by changing the indexing you can explore
# other days by changing the index. We also get the string corresponding to
# the date, to reference later:
snow_day = snow[0]
snow_day_dt = snow_day.coordinate("time")[0].data
snow_day_daystring = f"{snow_day_dt.datetime_as_string[0].split(' ')[0]}"

# %%
# 4. Choose the region to consider to compare the relationship across,
# which must be defined across both datasets, though not necessarily on the
# same grid since we regrid to the same grid next and subspace to the same
# area for both datasets ready for comparison in the next steps. By changing
# the latitude and longitude points in the tuple below, you can change the
# area that is used:
region_in_mid_uk = ((-3.0, -1.0), (52.0, 55.0))
sub_orog = orog.subspace(
    longitude=cf.wi(*region_in_mid_uk[0]), latitude=cf.wi(*region_in_mid_uk[1])
)
sub_snow = snow_day.subspace(
    longitude=cf.wi(*region_in_mid_uk[0]), latitude=cf.wi(*region_in_mid_uk[1])
)

# %%
# 5. Ensure data quality, since the standard name here corresponds to a
# unitless fraction, but the values are in the tens, so we need to
# normalise these to all lie between 0 and 1 and change the units
# appropriately:
sub_snow = (sub_snow - sub_snow.minimum()) / (sub_snow.range())
sub_snow.override_units("1", inplace=True)

# %%
# 6. Regrid the data so that they lie on the same grid and therefore each
# array structure has values with corresponding geospatial points that
# can be statistically compared. Here the elevation field is regridded to the
# snow field since the snow is higher-resolution, but the other way round is
# possible by switching the field order:
regridded_orog = sub_orog.regrids(sub_snow, method="linear")

# %%
# 7. Squeeze the snow data to remove the size 1 axes so we have arrays of
# the same dimensions for each of the two fields to compare:
sub_snow = sub_snow.squeeze()

# %%
# 8. Finally, perform the statistical calculation by using the SciPy method
# to find the Pearson correlation coefficient for the two arrays now they are
# in comparable form. Note we need to use 'scipy.stats.mstats' and not
# 'scipy.stats' for the 'pearsonr' method, to account for masked
# data in the array(s) properly:
coefficient = mstats.pearsonr(regridded_orog.array, sub_snow.array)
print(f"The Pearson correlation coefficient is: {coefficient}")

# %%
# 9. Make a final plot showing the two arrays side-by-side and quoting the
# determined Pearson correlation coefficient to illustrate the relationship
# and its strength visually. We use 'gpos' to position the plots in two
# columns and apply some specific axes ticks and labels for clarity.
