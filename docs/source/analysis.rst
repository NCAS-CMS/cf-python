----

Version |release| for version |version| of the CF conventions.

.. note:: **This version of cf is for Python 3 only** and there are
          :ref:`incompatible differences between versions 2.x and 3.x
          <two-to-three-changes>` of cf.

	  Scripts written for version 2.x but running under version
          3.x should either work as expected, or provide informative
          error messages on the new API usage. However, it is advised
          that the outputs of older scripts be checked when running
          with Python 3 versions of the cf library.

	  For version 2.x documentation, see the :ref:`older releases
	  <Older-releases>` page.
