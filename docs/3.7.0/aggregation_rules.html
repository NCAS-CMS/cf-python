<hr class="docutils" />
<p><em>David Hassell and Jonathan Gregory</em></p>
<p>Version 3.7.0 for version 1.8 of the CF conventions.</p>
<p>Aggregation is the combination of two field constructs to create a new
field construct that occupies a “larger” domain. In practice, this
means combining the two field constructs so that their data are
concatenated along one or more domain axis constructs, as are the data
of their metadata constructs which span those domain axis constructs.</p>
<p>These rules are be used for deciding whether or not two arbitrary
field constructs may be aggregated into one, larger field construct.
The rules are based solely on the field constructs’ metadata as
recognised by the <a class="reference internal" href="cf_data_model.html#cf-data-model"><span class="std std-ref">CF data model</span></a> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#cfdm" id="id2">1</a>. For example, netCDF
variable names are ignored during the aggregation process, meaning
that having different netCDF variable names does not preclude the
aggregation of two field constructs.</p>
<p>More than two field constructs are aggregated by repeated applications
of the aggregation algorithm, and aggregations over multiple domain
axis constructs are similarly possible.</p>
<p>Aggregation is implemented in the <a class="reference internal" href="function/cf.aggregate.html#cf.aggregate" title="cf.aggregate"><code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cf.aggregate</span></code></a> function, and is
applied by default by the <a class="reference internal" href="function/cf.read.html#cf.read" title="cf.read"><code class="xref py py-obj docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cf.read</span></code></a> function.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>If all of the following statements are true for two arbitrary field
constructs then the two field constructs may be aggregated to a new
field construct.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Both field constructs have identical standard name properties.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The treatment of other properties, in terms of how they should
match between the field constructs and whether or not they should be
included in the aggregated field, is beyond the scope of these
rules and is at the user’s discretion. This is also the case for
all other construct properties unnamed by these rules.</p></li>

are ordered differently or run in different senses then one of the

all array comparisons in these rules.</p></li>
