<p><em>David Hassell and Jonathan Gregory</em></p>
<p>Version 3.0.0 for version 1.7 of the CF conventions.</p>
<p>These rules are be used for deciding whether or not two arbitrary
field constructs may be aggregated into one, larger field
construct. These rules are based solely on the field constructs’
metadata as recognised by the <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-4619-2017">CF data model</a>.</p>
<p>Aggregation is the combination of one field construct into another to
create a new field construct that occupies a “larger” domain. In
practice, this means combining two field constructs so that their data
concatenated along exactly one domain axis, as are the data of their
metadata constructs which span that domain axis.</p>
<p>More than two field constructs are be aggregated by repeated
applications of the aggregation algorithm, and aggregations over
multiple domain axes are similarly possible.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>If all of the following statements are true for two arbitrary field
constructs then the two field constructs may be aggregated to a new
field construct.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Both field constructs have identical standard name properties.<ul>
<li>The treatment of other properties, in terms of how they should
match between the field constructs and whether or not they should be
included in the aggregated field, is beyond the scope of these
rules and is at the user’s discretion. This is also the case for
all other construct properties unnamed by these rules.</li>

are ordered differently or run in different senses then one of the
arrays must be rearranged prior to comparison. This is true for
all array comparisons in these rules.</li>
<li>If neither field construct has an aggregating axis then the field constructs are not
aggregatable because their domains are identical.</li>

it is not possible to choose the single domain axis for array
