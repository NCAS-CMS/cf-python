* The generation of recipes using Sphinx-Gallery requires:

  ```txt
  sphinx==2.4.5
  sphinx-gallery==0.11.0
  sphinx-copybutton==0.5.1
  sphinx-toggleprompt==0.2.0
  sphinxcontrib-spelling==4.3.0
  
* The `.py` files to generate recipes are stored in `docs/source/recipes/`.

* `docs/source/recipes/README.rst` creates an autogenerated Sphinx-Gallery
  index.html page.

* This index.html does not have the functionality to filter the recipes
  according to their functions. To achieve this, `docs/source/recipes/filter.
  rst` acts like a template where the Javascript, CSS and some of the HTML
  elements are added manually, whereas the remaining elements are taken
  directly from the generated index.html of Sphinx-Gallery. 

* After creation of a new `recipe.py` in `docs/source/recipes/` and running the
  build, the autogenerated Sphinx-Gallery index.html page displays the newly
  created recipe but without the filters on top. 

* To display the newly created recipe with the filters,
  `docs/source/recipes/filter.rst` has to be edited. This requires copying the
  generated lines from `/docs/_sources/recipes/index.rst.txt` for the new recipe
  to `docs/source/recipes/filter.rst`:
  
  ```html
  .. raw:: html

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="In this recipe, we will
    analyse and plot temperature trends from the HadCRUT.5.0.1.0 dataset
    fo...">
  
  .. only:: html

  .. image:: /recipes/images/thumb/sphx_glr_plot_8_recipe_thumb.png
    :alt: Plotting statistically significant temperature trends with stippling

  :ref:`sphx_glr_recipes_plot_8_recipe.py`
  
  .. raw:: html

      <div class="sphx-glr-thumbnail-title">Plotting statistically significant
      temperature trends with stippling</div> </div>
  ```

* The filters corresponding to the recipe are inserted in the
  `<div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer">` with a space separating multiple 
  filters, e.g.,

  ```html
  <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer collapse contourmap testfilter" 
  tooltip="In this recipe, we will analyse and plot temperature trends from the 
  HadCRUT.5.0.1.0 dataset fo...">
  ```
* If the filter doesn't exist, it has to be added in `<div class="filter-menu">` 
  alphabetically, e.g.,

  ```html
  <div class="filter-menu">
      <button data-filter="all">All</button>
      <button data-filter="aggregate">Aggregate</button>
      <button data-filter="collapse">Collapse</button>
      <button data-filter="contourmap">Contourmap</button>
      <button data-filter="lineplot">Lineplot</button>
      <button data-filter="regrid">Regrid</button>
      <button data-filter="subspace">Subspace</button>
      <button data-filter="testfilter">Test</button>
  </div>
  ```

* The newly created recipe should also be mentioned in the toctree, e.g.,

  ```rst
  .. toctree::
     :hidden:
  
     /recipes/plot_1_recipe
     /recipes/plot_2_recipe
     /recipes/plot_3_recipe
     /recipes/recipe
  ```
* Before updating the remote branch with local commits, autogenerated
  Sphinx-Gallery index.html page must be deleted and the generated `filter.html`
  should be renamed.
