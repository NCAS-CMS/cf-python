- [ ] Decide the version name to set for the new release, by
  heeding the Versioning Strategy (see
  https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-python/releases.html#versioning-strategy).

- [ ] Set the `NEXTVERSION` version marker across the codebase (added in PRs
  to mark the next version where the exact number/name is not yet decided)
  by recursively finding all occurences within the `cf` directory and replacing
  them with the upcoming version name `X.Y.Z` (replace `X`, `Y` and `Z`
  appropriately for the value of the now correct `cf.__version__`),
  via running this command in `cf-python` repo root
  directory (don't run it repo-wide or it will e.g. edit this script!):

  ```console
  $ find cf/ -type f | xargs sed -i 's/NEXTVERSION/X.Y.Z/g'
  ```

- [ ] Change the version and date in `cf/__init__.py` (`__version__` and
  `__date__` variables)

- [ ] Ensure that the requirements on dependencies & their versions are
  up-to-date and consistent in both the `requirements.txt` and in
  `docs/source/installation.rst`; and in the `_requires` list and
  `Version` checks in `cf/__init__.py`.

- [ ] Make sure that `README.md` is up to date.

- [ ] Make sure that the `long_description` in `setup.py` is up to date.

- [ ] Make sure that `Changelog.rst` is up to date (version, date and
  changes).

- [ ] Deprecated methods and keyword arguments: Check the code for
  deprecated methods and keyword arguments that can be completely
  removed, i.e. those with a ``removed_at`` version that is at or
  before the version being released. Remove any reference to them in
  the method, class, or fucntion (including, if appropriate, the
  ``@_deprecated_kwarg_check`` decorator), and remove them from the
  relevant documentation ``.rst`` files.

- [ ] Check that the documentation API coverage is complete:

  ```bash
  ./check_docs_api_coverage
  ```

  - [ ] If it is not complete, add any undocumented attributes, methods,
    functions and keyword arguments (e.g. as listed in the change log)
    to the `.rst` files in `docs/source/class/`.

- [ ] Check external links to the CF conventions are up to date in
  `docs/source/tutorial.rst` and `docs/source/field_analysis.rst`

- [ ] Create a link to the new documentation in
  `docs/source/releases.rst`, including the release date.

- [ ] Test tutorial code:

  ```bash
  export PYTHONPATH=$PWD:$PYTHONPATH
  ./test_tutorial_code
  ```

- [ ] **Follow all of the steps outlined externally in `DOCUMENTATION.md`**,
  notably so that the correct Sphinx-related environment is prepared for
  documentation building.
  
- [ ] Ensure that the [PDF for Cheat Sheet](docs/_downloads/cheatsheet.pdf) 
  is updated to include any API changes. The PDF is created using Canva 
  keeping in mind the colours and fonts of the website. The same could 
  be edited using this 
  [link](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFk9_BVfNY/gmQHycBiV_YbTIWMqYxK1g/edit).

- [ ] Build a development copy of the documentation using to check API
  pages for any new methods are present & correct, & that the overall
  formatting has not been adversely affected for comprehension by any
  updates in the latest Sphinx or theme etc. (Do not manually commit
  the dev build.)

  ```bash
  ./release_docs dev-scrub
  ```

- [ ] Check that no typos or spelling mistakes have been introduced to the
  documentation:

  - [ ] Run a dummy build of the documentation to detect invalid words:

     ```console
     $ cd docs
     $ make spelling build
     ```

  - [ ] If there are words raised with 'Spell check' warnings for the dummy
    build, such as:

    ```bash
    /home/sadie/cf-python/docs/source/class/cf.NetCDFArray.rst:18: Spell check: isw: element in the sequence isw the name of the group in which.
    Writing /home/sadie/cf-python/docs/spelling/class/cf.NetCDFArray.spelling
    /home/sadie/cf-python/docs/source/class/cf.Query.rst:3: Spell check: encapulates:  object encapulates a condition, such as.
    ```

    they may or may not be typos or mis-spellings. Address all the warnings
    (except those relating to files under `docs/source/class/`,
    `/attribute` or `/function` which will be fixed along with the origin
    docstrings after a 'latest' build) as follows:

    - [ ] If there are words that are in fact valid, add the valid words to
      the list of false positives for the spelling checker extension,
      `docs/source/spelling_false_positives.txt`.
    - [ ] Correct any words that are not valid in the codebase under `cf` or
      in the `docs/source` content files.

  - [ ] Note that, in the case there are many words raised as warnings, it
    helps to automate the above steps. The following commands are a means
    to do this processing:

    1. Copy all 'spell check' warnings output to STDOUT during the build to
       a file (here we use `spellings-file-1` as an example name).
    2. Cut all of the words from the warnings via
       `cat spellings-file-1 | cut -d':' -f 4 > spellings-file-2`
    3. Sift through these new words and remove any words that are true
       positives i.e. typos or mis-spellings. Correct them in the
       docstrings or documentation source files. If there are many
       instances across the docs, it helps to do a substitution of all
       occurences, e.g. via `find . -type f | xargs sed -i 's/<typo>/<correction>/g'`,
       though take care to have spaces surrounding words which may be
       part of other words, e.g. use
       `find . -type f | xargs sed -i 's/ ot / to /g'` to correct `ot` to `to`.
    4. Remove the leading whitespace character on each line and add
       all the new words to the current list of false positives:
       `sed 's/^.//' spellings-file-2 >> docs/source/spelling_false_positives.txt`
    5. Remove duplicate words and sort alphabetically via:
       `sort -u -o docs/source/spelling_false_positives.txt docs/source/spelling_false_positives.txt`

- [ ] Create an archived copy of the documentation:

  ```bash
  ./release_docs archive
  ```

- [ ] Update the latest documentation:

  ```bash
  ./release_docs latest
  ```
  
- [ ] Create a source tarball:

  ```bash
  python setup.py sdist
  ```

- [ ] Test the tarball release using

  ```bash
  ./test_release <vn> # E.g. ./test_release 3.14.0
  ```

- [ ] Push recent commits using

  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```
  
- [ ] Tag the release:

  ```bash
  ./tag <vn> # E.g. ./tag 3.14.0
  ```
  
- [ ] Upload the source tarball to PyPI. Note this requires the `twine`
  library (which can be installed via `pip`) and relevant project
  privileges on PyPI.

  ```bash
  ./upload_to_pypi <vn> # E.g. ./upload_to_pypi 3.14.0
  ```

- [ ] Update the GitHub releases page for the new version:
  https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-python/releases
  
- [ ] Upload the new release to Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/record/3961353

- [ ] Copy the archive docs to https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-python-docs

- [ ] Move and commit the previously-generated archived copy of the documentation to https://github.com/NCAS-CMS/cf-python-docs (fork or clone that repo first):

  ```bash
  mv docs/<vn>/ ~/cf-python-docs/
  cd ~/cf-python-docs/
  git add <vn>/
  # Then commit and push to the NCAS-CMS repo (named origin or upstream as appropriate)
  ```
