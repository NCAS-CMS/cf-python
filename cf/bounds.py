    '''A cell bounds component of a coordinate or domain ancillary
construct of the CF data model.

An array of cell bounds spans the same domain axes as its coordinate
array, with the addition of an extra dimension whose size is that of
the number of vertices of each cell. This extra dimension does not
correspond to a domain axis construct since it does not relate to an
independent axis of the domain. Note that, for climatological time
axes, the bounds are interpreted in a special way indicated by the
cell method constructs.

In the CF data model, a bounds component does not have its own
properties because they can not logically be different to those of the
coordinate construct itself. However, it is sometimes desired to store
attributes on a CF-netCDF bounds variable, so it is also allowed to
provide properties to a bounds component.

**NetCDF interface**

The netCDF variable name of the bounds may be accessed with the
`nc_set_variable`, `nc_get_variable`, `nc_del_variable` and
`nc_has_variable` methods.

The name of the trailing netCDF dimension spanned by bounds (which
does not correspond to a domain axis construct) may be accessed with
the `nc_set_dimension`, `nc_get_dimension`, `nc_del_dimension` and
`nc_has_dimension` methods.

    def contiguous(self, overlap=True, direction=None):
        '''Return True if the bounds are contiguous.

    Bounds are contiguous if the cell boundaries match up, or overlap,
    with the boundaries of adjacent cells.
    
    In general, it is only possible for 1 or 0 variable dimensional
    variables with bounds to be contiguous, but size 1 variables with
    any number of dimensions are always contiguous.
    
    An exception is raised if the variable is multdimensional and has
    more than one element.
