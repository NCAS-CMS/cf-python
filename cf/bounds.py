class Bounds(mixin.Coordinate, mixin.PropertiesData, cfdm.Bounds):
    """A cell bounds component of a coordinate or domain ancillary
    construct of the CF data model.

    An array of cell bounds spans the same domain axes as its
    coordinate array, with the addition of an extra dimension whose
    size is that of the number of vertices of each cell. This extra
    dimension does not correspond to a domain axis construct since it
    does not relate to an independent axis of the domain. Note that,
    for climatological time axes, the bounds are interpreted in a
    special way indicated by the cell method constructs.

    In the CF data model, a bounds component does not have its own
    properties because they can not logically be different to those of
    the coordinate construct itself. However, it is sometimes desired
    to store attributes on a CF-netCDF bounds variable, so it is also
    allowed to provide properties to a bounds component.

    **NetCDF interface**

    {{netCDF variable}}

    The name of the trailing netCDF dimension spanned by bounds (which
    does not correspond to a domain axis construct) may be accessed
    with the `nc_set_dimension`, `nc_get_dimension`,
    `nc_del_dimension` and `nc_has_dimension` methods.

    def contiguous(self, overlap=True, direction=None, period=None, verbose=1):
        """Return True if the bounds are contiguous.

         Bounds are contiguous if the cell boundaries match up, or
         overlap, with the boundaries of adjacent cells.

         In general, it is only possible for 1 or 0 variable
         dimensional variables with bounds to be contiguous, but size
         1 variables with any number of dimensions are always
         contiguous.

         An exception is raised if the variable is multidimensional
         and has more than one element.

        .. versionadded:: 2.0

        :Parameters:

             overlap: `bool`, optional
                 If False then 1-d cells with two bounds vertices are
                 not considered contiguous if any adjacent cells
                 overlap each other. By default such cells are
                 considered contiguous.

             direction:
                 Specify the direction of 1-d coordinates with two
                 bounds vertices. Either True for increasing
                 coordinates, or False for decreasing coordinates. By
                 default the direction is inferred from whether the
                 first bound of the first cell is less than its second
                 bound (direction is True), or not (direction is
                 False).

             period: optional
                 Define the period of cyclic values so that the test
                 for contiguousness can be carried out with modulo
                 arithmetic. By default the data are assumed to be
                 non-cyclic, unless the bounds have units of longitude
                 (or have units of ``'degrees'``), in which case a
                 period of 360 degrees is assumed.

             {{verbose: `int` or `str` or `None`, optional}}

         :Returns:

             `bool`
                 Whether or not the cells are contiguous.
