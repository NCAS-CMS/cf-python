    .. versionadded:: 3.14.0

    .. seealso:: `regrid_weights`, `_regrid`, `cf.Data._regrid`

    :Parameters:

        a: `numpy.ndarray`
            The array to be regridded.

        weights_dst_mask: 2-`tuple`
            The sparse weights matrix that defines the regridding
            operation; and the mask to be applied to the regridded
            data (as yet unmodified for the source grid mask).

            **weights**

            The dense weights matrix has J rows and I columns, where J
            and I are the total number of cells in the destination and
            source grids respectively.

            The weights matrix only describes cells defined by the
            regridding dimensions. If the array *a* includes
            non-regridding dimensions then, in essence, the regrid
            operation is carried out separately for each slice of the
            regridding dimensions. For instance, if *a* represents T,
            Z, Y, X dimensions with shape ``(12, 20, 73, 96)`` and is
            to have its Y and X dimension regridded, then the result
            may be thought of as the concatenation of the 240
            individual regrids arising from all of the T and Z
            dimension combinations.

            Each element w_ji is the multiplicative weight that
            defines how much of Vs_i (the value in source grid cell i)
            contributes to Vd_j (the value in destination grid cell
            j).

            The final value of Vd_j is the sum of w_ji * Vs_i for all
            source grid cells i. Note that it is typical that for a
            given j most w_ji will be zero, reflecting the fact only a
            few source grid cells intersect a particular destination
            grid cell. I.e. *weights* is typically a very sparse
            matrix.

            If the destination grid has masked cells, either because
            it spans areas outside of the source grid, or by selection
            (such as ocean cells for land-only data), then the
            corresponding rows in the weights matrix must be be
            entirely missing data.

            For the patch recovery and second-order conservative
            regridding methods, the weights matrix will have been
            constructed taking into account the mask of the source
            grid, which must match the mask of *a* for its regridding
            dimensions.

            For all other regridding methods, the weights matrix will
            have been constructed assuming that no source grid cells
            are masked, and the weights matrix will be modified
            on-the-fly to account for any masked elements of *a* in
            each regridding slice.

            It is assumed that data-type of the weights matrix is same
            as the desired data-type of the regridded data.

            See section 12.3 "Regridding Methods" of
            https://earthsystemmodeling.org/docs/release/latest/ESMF_refdoc/node1.html

            **dst_mask**

            If a `numpy.ndarray` with shape ``(J,)`` then this is the
            reference destination grid mask that was used during the
            creation of the weights. If `None` then there are no
            reference destination grid masked points.

            In either case the reference destination grid mask may get
            updated (not in-place) to account for source grid masked
            points.

        method: `str`
            The name of the regridding method.

        src_shape: sequence of `int`
            The shape of the source grid.

        dst_shape: sequence of `int`
            The shape of the destination grid.

        axis_order: sequence of `int`
            The axis order that transposes *a* so that the regrid axes
            become the trailing dimensions, ordered consistently with
            the order used to create the weights matrix; and the
            non-regrid axes become the leading dimensions.

            *Parameter example:*
              If the regrid axes are in positions 2 and 1 for 4-d
              data: ``[0, 3, 2, 1]``

            *Parameter example:*
              If the regrid axes are in positions 0 and 3 for 4-d
              data: ``[1, 2, 0, 3]``

            *Parameter example:*
              If the regrid axis is in position 0 for 3-d data: ``[1,
              2, 0]``

        ref_src_mask: `numpy.ndarray` or `None`
            If a `numpy.ndarray` with shape *src_shape* then this is
            the reference source grid mask that was used during the
            creation of the weights matrix given by *weights*, and the
            mask of each regrid slice of *a* must therefore be
            identical to *ref_src_mask*. If *ref_src_mask* is a scalar
            array with value `False`, then this is equivalent to a
            reference source grid mask with shape *src_shape* entirely
            populated with `False`.

            If `None` (the default), then the weights matrix will have
            been created assuming no source grid mask, and the mask of
            each regrid slice of *a* is automatically applied to
            *weights* prior to the regridding calculation.

        min_weight: float, optional
            A very small non-negative number. By default *min_weight*
            is ``2.5 * np.finfo("float64").eps``,
            i.e. ``5.551115123125783e-16`. It is used during linear
            and first-order conservative regridding when adjusting the
            weights matrix to account for the data mask. It is ignored
            for all other regrid methods, or if data being regridded
            has no missing values.

            In some cases (described below) for which weights might
            only be non-zero as a result of rounding errors, the
            *min_weight* parameter controls whether or a not cell in
            the regridded field is masked.

            The default value has been chosen empirically as the
            smallest value that produces the same masks as esmpy for
            the use cases defined in the cf test suite.

            **Linear regridding**

            Destination grid cell j will only be masked if a) it is
            masked in the destination grid definition; or b) ``w_ji >=
            min_weight`` for those masked source grid cells i for
            which ``w_ji > 0``.

            **Conservative first-order regridding**

            Destination grid cell j will only be masked if a) it is
            masked in the destination grid definition; or b) the sum
            of ``w_ji`` for all non-masked source grid cells i is
            strictly less than *min_weight*.

    :Returns:

        `numpy.ndarray`
            The regridded data.

        a: `numpy.ndarray`
            The array to be regridded. Must have shape ``(I, n)``,
            where ``I`` is the number of source grid cells and ``n``
            is the number of regrid slices. Performance will be
            optimised if *a* has Fortran order memory layout
            (column-major order).

        src_mask: `numpy.ndarray` or `None`
            The source grid mask to be applied to the weights
            matrix. If `None` then no source grid cells are masked. If
            a Boolean `numpy` array then it must have shape ``(I,)``,
            where ``I`` is the number of source grid cells, and `True`
            signifies a masked cell.

        dst_mask: `numpy.ndarray` or `None`
            The reference destination grid mask to be applied to the
            regridded data. If `None` then this is equivalent to a
            mask of all `False`. If a Boolean `numpy` array then it
            must have shape ``(J,)``, where ``J`` is the number of
            destination grid cells, and `True` signifies a masked
            cell.

        weights: `scipy.sparse.spmatrix`
            The sparse weights matrix that defines the regridding
            operation. Might be modified (not in-place) to account for
            missing data in *a*. Must have shape ``(J, I)``, where

            A very small non-negative number. It is used during linear

            The name of the regridding method.

            The source grid mask used by a previous call to `_regrid`.
            See *prev_weights* for details.

        prev_dst_mask: `numpy.ndarray` or `None`
            The destination grid mask used by a previous call to
            `_regrid`. If *prev_src_mask* equals *src_mask* then the
            *prev_dst_mask* mask is used to calculate the regridded
            data, bypassing any need to calculate a new destination
            grid mask. Ignored if `prev_src_mask` is `None`.

        prev_weights: `numpy.ndarray`, optional
            The weights matrix used by a previous call to `_regrid`,
            possibly modified to account for missing data. If
            *prev_src_mask* equals *src_mask* then the *prev_weights*
