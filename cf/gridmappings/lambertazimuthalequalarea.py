    :Parameters:

        longitude_of_projection_origin: number or scalar `Data`, optional
            The longitude of projection center (PROJ 'lon_0' value).
            If provided as a number or `Data` without units, the units
            are taken as 'degrees_east', else the `Data` units are
            taken and must be angular and compatible with longitude.
            The default is 0.0 degrees_east.

        latitude_of_projection_origin: number or scalar `Data`, optional
            The latitude of projection center (PROJ 'lat_0' value).
            If provided as a number or `Data` without units, the units
            are taken as 'degrees_north', else the `Data` units are
            taken and must be angular and compatible with latitude.
            The default is 0.0 degrees_north.

        false_easting: number or scalar `Data`, optional
            The false easting (PROJ 'x_0') value.
            If provided as a number or `Data` without units, the units
            are taken as metres 'm', else the `Data` units are
            taken and must be compatible with distance.
            The default is 0.0 metres.

        false_northing: number or scalar `Data`, optional
            The false northing (PROJ 'y_0') value.
            If provided as a number or `Data` without units, the units
            are taken as metres 'm', else the `Data` units are
            taken and must be compatible with distance.
            The default is 0.0 metres.
