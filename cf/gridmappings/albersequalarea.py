    :Parameters:

        standard_parallel: 2-`tuple` of number or scalar `Data` or `None`
            The standard parallel value(s): the first (PROJ 'lat_1'
            value) and/or the second (PROJ 'lat_2' value), given
            as a 2-tuple of numbers or strings corresponding to
            the first and then the second in order, where `None`
            indicates that a value is not being set for either.

            If provided as a number or `Data` without units, the units
            for each of the values are taken as 'degrees_north', else
            the `Data` units are taken and must be angular and
            compatible with latitude.

        longitude_of_central_meridian: number or scalar `Data`, optional
            The longitude of (natural) origin i.e. central meridian.
            If provided as a number or `Data` without units, the units
            are taken as 'degrees_east', else the `Data` units are
            taken and must be angular and compatible with longitude.
            The default is 0.0 degrees_east.

        latitude_of_projection_origin: number or scalar `Data`, optional
            The latitude of projection center (PROJ 'lat_0' value).
            If provided as a number or `Data` without units, the units
            are taken as 'degrees_north', else the `Data` units are
            taken and must be angular and compatible with latitude.
            The default is 0.0 degrees_north.

        false_easting: number or scalar `Data`, optional
            The false easting (PROJ 'x_0') value.
            If provided as a number or `Data` without units, the units
            are taken as metres 'm', else the `Data` units are
            taken and must be compatible with distance.
            The default is 0.0 metres.

        false_northing: number or scalar `Data`, optional
            The false northing (PROJ 'y_0') value.
            If provided as a number or `Data` without units, the units
            are taken as metres 'm', else the `Data` units are
            taken and must be compatible with distance.
            The default is 0.0 metres.
