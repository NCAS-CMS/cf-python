class SubspaceField(mixin.Subspace):
    """Create a subspace of a field construct.

    Creation of a new field construct which spans a subspace of the
    domain of an existing field construct is achieved either by
    identifying indices based on the metadata constructs (subspacing
    by metadata) or by indexing the field construct directly
    (subspacing by index).

    The subspacing operation, in either case, also subspaces any
    metadata constructs of the field construct (e.g. coordinate
    metadata constructs) which span any of the domain axis constructs
    that are affected. The new field construct is created with the
    same properties as the original field construct.

    **Subspacing by metadata**

    Subspacing by metadata, signified by the use of round brackets,
    selects metadata constructs and specifies conditions on their
    data. Indices for subspacing are then automatically inferred from
    where the conditions are met.

    Metadata constructs and the conditions on their data are defined
    by keyword parameters.

    * Any domain axes that have not been identified remain unchanged.

    * Multiple domain axes may be subspaced simultaneously, and it
      doesn't matter which order they are specified in.

    * Subspace criteria may be provided for size 1 domain axes that
      are not spanned by the field construct's data.

    * Explicit indices may also be assigned to a domain axis
      identified by a metadata construct, with either a Python `slice`
      object, or a sequence of integers or booleans.

    * For a dimension that is cyclic, a subspace defined by a slice or
      by a `Query` instance is assumed to "wrap" around the edges of
      the data.

    * Conditions may also be applied to multi-dimensional metadata
      constructs. The "compress" mode is still the default mode (see
      the positional arguments), but because the indices may not be
      acting along orthogonal dimensions, some missing data may still
      need to be inserted into the field construct's data.

    **Subspacing by index**

    Subspacing by indexing, signified by the use of square brackets,
    uses rules that are very similar to the numpy indexing rules, the
    only differences being:

    * An integer index i specified for a dimension reduces the size of
      this dimension to unity, taking just the i-th element, but keeps
      the dimension itself, so that the rank of the array is not
      reduced.

    * When two or more dimensionsâ€™ indices are sequences of integers
      then these indices work independently along each dimension
      (similar to the way vector subscripts work in Fortran). This is
      the same indexing behaviour as on a Variable object of the
      netCDF4 package.

    * For a dimension that is cyclic, a range of indices specified by
      a `slice` that spans the edges of the data (such as ``-2:3`` or
      ``3:-2:-1``) is assumed to "wrap" around, rather then producing
      a null result.

    :Parameters:

        positional arguments: *optional*
            There are three modes of operation, each of which provides
            a different type of subspace:

            ==============  ==========================================
            *argument*      Description
            ==============  ==========================================
            ``'compress'``  This is the default mode. Unselected
                            locations are removed to create the
                            returned subspace. Note that if a
                            multi-dimensional metadata construct is
                            being used to define the indices then some
                            missing data may still be inserted at
                            unselected locations.

            ``'envelope'``  The returned subspace is the smallest that
                            contains all of the selected
                            indices. Missing data is inserted at
                            unselected locations within the envelope.

            ``'full'``      The returned subspace has the same domain
                            as the original field construct. Missing
                            data is inserted at unselected locations.
            ==============  ==========================================

        keyword parameters: *optional*
            A keyword name is an identity of a metadata construct, and
            the keyword value provides a condition for inferring
            indices that apply to the dimension (or dimensions)
            spanned by the metadata construct's data. Indices are
            created that select every location for which the metadata
            construct's data satisfies the condition.

    :Returns:

        `Field`
            An independent field construct containing the subspace of
            the original field.
