class Constructs(cfdm.Constructs):
    '''A container for metadata constructs.

    The following metadata constructs can be included:

    * auxiliary coordinate constructs
    * coordinate reference constructs
    * cell measure constructs
    * dimension coordinate constructs
    * domain ancillary constructs
    * domain axis constructs
    * cell method constructs
    * field ancillary constructs

    The container may be used by `Field` and `Domain` instances. In
    the latter case cell method and field ancillary constructs must be
    flagged as "ignored" (see the *_ignore* parameter).

    The container is like a dictionary in many ways, in that it stores
    key/value pairs where the key is the unique construct key with
    corresponding metadata construct value, and provides some of the
    usual dictionary methods.

    **Calling**

    Calling a `Constructs` instance selects metadata constructs by
    identity and is an alias for the `filter_by_identity` method. For
    example, to select constructs that have an identity of
    'air_temperature': ``d = c('air_temperature')``.

#
# .. versionadded:: 3.0.0
#
# :Parameters:
#
#     identity:
#
#         Select the 1-d coordinate constructs that have the given
#         identity.
#
#         An identity is specified by a string (e.g. ``'latitude'``,
#         ``'long_name=time'``, etc.); or a compiled regular expression
#         (e.g. ``re.compile('^atmosphere')``), for which all constructs
#         whose identities match (via `re.search`) are selected.
#
#         Each coordinate construct has a number of identities, and is
#         selected if any of them match any of those provided. A
#         construct's identities are those returned by its `!identities`
#         method. In the following example, the construct ``x`` has four
#         identities:
#
#            >>> x.identities()
#            ['time', 'long_name=Time', 'foo=bar', 'ncvar%T']
#
#         In addition, each construct also has an identity based its
#         construct key (e.g. ``'key%dimensioncoordinate2'``)
#
#         Note that in the output of a `print` call or `!dump` method, a
#         construct is always described by one of its identities, and so
#         this description may always be used as an *identity* argument.
#
#     default: optional
#         Return the value of the *default* parameter if a domain axis
#         construct can not be found. If set to an `Exception` instance
#         then it will be raised instead.
#
# :Returns:
#
#     `str`
#         The key of the domain axis construct that is spanned by the
#         data of the selected 1-d coordinate constructs.

    :Parameters:

        identities: optional
            Select constructs that have any of the given identities or
            construct keys.

            An identity is specified by a string (e.g. ``'latitude'``,
            ``'long_name=time'``, etc.); or a compiled regular
            expression (e.g. ``re.compile('^atmosphere')``), for which
            all constructs whose identities match (via `re.search`)
            are selected.

            If no identities are provided then all constructs are selected.

            Each construct has a number of identities, and is selected
            if any of them match any of those provided. A construct's
            identities are those returned by its `!identities`
            method. In the following example, the construct ``x`` has
            five identities:

               >>> x.identities()
               ['time', 'long_name=Time', 'foo=bar', 'T', 'ncvar%t']

            A construct key may optionally have the ``'key%'``
            prefix. For example ``'dimensioncoordinate2'`` and
            ``'key%dimensioncoordinate2'`` are both acceptable keys.

            Note that the identifiers of a metadata construct in the
            output of a `print` or `!dump` call are always one of its
            identities, and so may always be used as an *identities*
            argument.

            Domain axis constructs may also be identified by their
            position in the field construct's data array. Positions
            are specified by either integers.

            .. note:: This is an extension to the functionality of
                      `cfdm.Constucts.filter_by_identity`.

    :Returns:

        `Constructs`
            The selected constructs and their construct keys.

    **Examples:**

    Select constructs that have a "standard_name" property of
    'latitude':

    >>> d = c.filter_by_identity('latitude')

    Select constructs that have a "long_name" property of 'Height':

    >>> d = c.filter_by_identity('long_name=Height')

    Select constructs that have a "standard_name" property of
    'latitude' or a "foo" property of 'bar':

    >>> d = c.filter_by_identity('latitude', 'foo=bar')

    Select constructs that have a netCDF variable name of 'time':

    >>> d = c.filter_by_identity('ncvar%time')
