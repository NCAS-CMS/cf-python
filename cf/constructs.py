class Constructs(cfdm.Constructs):
    """A container for metadata constructs.

    The following metadata constructs can be included:

    * auxiliary coordinate constructs
    * coordinate reference constructs
    * cell measure constructs
    * dimension coordinate constructs
    * domain ancillary constructs
    * domain axis constructs
    * cell method constructs
    * field ancillary constructs

    The container may be used by `Field` and `Domain` instances. In
    the latter case cell method and field ancillary constructs must be
    flagged as "ignored" (see the *_ignore* parameter).

    The container is like a dictionary in many ways, in that it stores
    key/value pairs where the key is the unique construct key with
    corresponding metadata construct value, and provides some of the
    usual dictionary methods.

    **Calling**

    Calling a `Constructs` instance selects metadata constructs by
    identity and is an alias for the `filter_by_identity` method. For
    example, to select constructs that have an identity of
    'air_temperature': ``d = c('air_temperature')``.
