# Configure pre-commit hooks to check for Python code validity, formatting and
# style issues and prompt for these to be corrected before committing.

repos:

  # Use specific format-enforcing pre-commit hooks from the core library
  # with the default configuration (see pre-commit.com for documentation)
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v2.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: check-ast

      - id: end-of-file-fixer
        types: [python]
      - id: trailing-whitespace
        types: [python]

  # Also validate against 'black' for unambiguous Python formatting
  # (see https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ for documentation and see
  # the cf-python pyproject.toml file for our custom black configuration)
  - repo: https://github.com/ambv/black
    rev: stable

  # Also format docstrings in a consistent way, on top of 'black' requirements
  # with the aim to auto-correct towards the Google docstring format (see
  # https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#381-docstrings) as much
  # as possible (see https://github.com/myint/docformatter for docs, with
  # configuration as below)
  - repo: https://github.com/myint/docformatter
    rev: v1.4
    hooks:
      - id: docformatter
        # These arguments act as the configuration for docformatter. They:
        # * make docformatter auto-format in-place if not compliant;
        # * ensure there is a blank line after the final non-empty line;
        # * wraps both summary and description at 72 characters (the latter
        #   by default).
        args: [--in-place, --blank, --wrap-summaries=72]

  # Additionally validate againt flake8 for other Python style enforcement
  # (see https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/ for documentation and see
  # the cf-python .flake8 file for our custom flake8 configuration)
