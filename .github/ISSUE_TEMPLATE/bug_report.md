To report a bug, please provide:

* A description of the issue with, if possible,
  - what you expected to happen,
  - the steps needed to reproduce it,
  - any traceback information.
  
* The version of the software and the environment in which you are encountering an issue. The output of `cf.environment(paths=False)` is useful for this.
