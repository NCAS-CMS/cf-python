=========

The Python `cf` package is an Earth Science data analysis library that
is built on a complete implementation of the CF data model.

Dask
====

From version 3.14.0 the `cf` package uses
[Dask](https://docs.dask.org) for all of its data manipulations.

Functionality
=============

The `cf` package implements the [CF data
model](https://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/cf-conventions.html#appendix-CF-data-model)
for its internal data structures and so is able to process any
CF-compliant dataset. It is not strict about CF-compliance, however,
so that partially conformant datasets may be ingested from existing
datasets and written to new datasets. This is so that datasets which
are partially conformant may nonetheless be modified in memory.

A simple example of reading a field construct from a file and
inspecting it:

    >>> import cf
    >>> f = cf.read('file.nc')
    >>> print(f[0])
    Field: air_temperature (ncvar%tas)
    ----------------------------------
    Data            : air_temperature(time(12), latitude(64), longitude(128)) K
    Cell methods    : time(12): mean (interval: 1.0 month)
    Dimension coords: time(12) = [1991-11-16 00:00:00, ..., 1991-10-16 12:00:00] noleap
                    : latitude(64) = [-87.8638, ..., 87.8638] degrees_north
                    : longitude(128) = [0.0, ..., 357.1875] degrees_east
                    : height(1) = [2.0] m

The `cf` package uses
[Dask](https://ncas-cms.github.io/cf-python/performance.html) for all
of its array manipulation and can:

* read field constructs from netCDF, CDL, PP and UM datasets,

* create new field constructs in memory,

* write and append field constructs to netCDF datasets on disk,

* read, write, and create coordinates defined by geometry cells,

* read netCDF and CDL datasets containing hierarchical groups,

* inspect field constructs,

* test whether two field constructs are the same,

* modify field construct metadata and data,

* create subspaces of field constructs,

* write field constructs to netCDF datasets on disk,

* incorporate, and create, metadata stored in external files,

* read, write, and create data that have been compressed by convention
  (i.e. ragged or gathered arrays, or coordinate arrays compressed by
  subsampling), whilst presenting a view of the data in its
  uncompressed form,

* combine field constructs arithmetically,

* manipulate field construct data by arithmetical and trigonometrical
  operations,

* perform statistical collapses on field constructs,

* perform histogram, percentile and binning operations on field
  constructs,

* regrid field constructs with (multi-)linear, nearest neighbour,
  first- and second-order conservative and higher order patch recovery
  methods,

* apply convolution filters to field constructs,

* create running means from field constructs,

* apply differential operators to field constructs,

* create derived quantities (such as relative vorticity).

Visualization
=============

Powerful, flexible, and very simple to produce visualizations of field
constructs are available with the [cfplot
package](http://ajheaps.github.io/cf-plot), that needs to be installed
seprately to the `cf` package.

See the [cf-plot
gallery](http://ajheaps.github.io/cf-plot/gallery.html) for the full
range range plotting possibilities with example code.

Command line utilities
======================

During installation the ``cfa`` command line utility is also
installed, which

* generates text descriptions of field constructs contained in files,
  and

* creates new datasets aggregated from existing files.


Tests
=====

Tests are run from within the ``cf/test`` directory:

    python run_tests.py
